# Automated Drone Landing System Using Acoustic Sensors

## Overview
This project develops an automated drone landing Signal generating system utilizing acoustic sensors for precise and reliable landings, even in low-visibility conditions. By generating signal vectors using chirp spread spectrum and adding attenuation and white Gaussian noise, the system accurately evaluates the distance between the drone and the landing pad microphones.

## Features
- **Acoustic Sensor Integration:** Uses ultrasonic sensors to measure distance and detect position of Drone from landing pad.
- **Environmental Adaptability:** Operates effectively in various conditions with No visibility.
- **Precision Landing:** Ensures accurate and safe landings.
- **Low Power Consumption:** Efficient sensor usage conserves drone battery life.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/drone-landing-system.git
   cd drone-landing-system
