# EchoLand
This project develops an automated drone landing system using acoustic sensors, leveraging chirp spread spectrum signals with added attenuation and white Gaussian noise to evaluate distance. This ensures precise and reliable landings in conditions with limited visibility, overcoming the limitations of camera-based systems.
